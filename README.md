# Lesson 3 - Arduino Projects

This repository contains Arduino projects developed in Lesson 3, featuring light-dependent LED control and a simple musical instrument using buttons and a buzzer.

---

## Projects Overview

### 1. Light-Dependent LED Brightness Control

- Uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) connected to analog pin A0 to measure ambient light levels.
- An LED connected to PWM pin 9 changes its brightness inversely proportional to the ambient light:
  - The brighter the environment, the dimmer the LED.
- The LDR reading values (0 to 1023) are mapped to LED brightness (255 to 0).
- LDR readings are sent to the Serial Monitor for observation.

### 2. Button-Controlled Musical Buzzer with LEDs

- Five buttons connected to digital pins 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, each associated with a specific musical note.
- When a button is pressed, the buzzer plays the corresponding note (C, D, E, F, or G).
- Each button press also lights up a corresponding LED (pins 11 to 15).
- When no button is pressed, the buzzer is silent and all LEDs are off.
- Buttons are configured with internal pull-up resistors.

# Lesson 4 - Arduino Projects

This repository contains several Arduino projects developed in Lesson 4, demonstrating the use of potentiometers to control RGB LEDs, serial communication to toggle LEDs, and ultrasonic sensor distance measurement with buzzer and LED alerts.

---

## Projects Overview

### 1. RGB LED Control Using Potentiometers

- Three potentiometers are connected to analog inputs A0, A1, and A2 to control the brightness of red, green, and blue LEDs respectively.
- The analog values from the potentiometers are read, mapped from 0-1023 to 0-255 PWM range, and output to the corresponding LED pins using PWM.
- Provides smooth color mixing by adjusting LED brightness.

### 2. Serial Controlled LEDs

- Three LEDs (red, green, blue) connected to digital pins 7, 8, and 12.
- Using the serial monitor, typing 'r', 'g', or 'b' toggles the respective LED on or off.
- Invalid key inputs prompt a message indicating valid commands.

### 3. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with Buzzer and LED Alert System

- Uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04 or similar) with trigger and echo pins to measure distance.
- A buzzer and six LEDs (pins 8 to 13) provide audible and visual alerts based on the detected distance.
- If the object is very close (â‰¤10 cm), all LEDs turn on and buzzer sounds continuously.
- For distances between 11 cm and 60 cm, LEDs light up progressively and buzzer beeps with intervals decreasing as the object gets closer.
- Above 60 cm, all LEDs and buzzer are turned off.

### 4. Basic Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection

- Simple ultrasonic sensor setup to detect if an obstacle is within a 20 cm threshold.
- Prints distance readings and obstacle detection status to the serial monitor.

# Motion Security System with PIR Sensor

# Lesson 5 - Arduino Projects

This project is a basic motion detection alarm using an Arduino board, a PIR sensor, an LED, and a buzzer. The system detects motion and activates alerts accordingly, with Serial Monitor output for motion logs.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- PIR motion sensor  
- LED  
- Buzzer (active or passive)  
- 220Î© resistors (for LED and optionally buzzer)  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard  

## Wiring

| Component  | Arduino Pin |  
|------------|-------------|  
| PIR Sensor | D7          |  
| LED        | D5          |  
| Buzzer     | D6          |  

## How It Works

1. On power-up, the system waits **30 seconds** to allow the PIR sensor to calibrate.  
2. Once calibrated, it actively checks for motion.  
3. If motion is detected:  
   - The **LED lights up**  
   - The **buzzer sounds (500 Hz)**  
   - A message appears in the **Serial Monitor** with the timestamp  
4. If no motion is detected for **5 seconds**, the system:  
   - Turns off the LED and buzzer  
   - Logs that motion has ended  

## Configuration

You can easily tweak two main variables:

```cpp
int calibrationTime = 30;   // time for PIR sensor to calibrate (in seconds)
unsigned long pause = 5000; // time (in ms) to wait after no motion

This collection of Arduino projects was developed as part of the course under the guidance of Professor Marcelo Lima at Senac Registro.
